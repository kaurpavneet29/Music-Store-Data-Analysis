This project is dedicated to analyzing the dataset of an online music store. Through SQL queries, I explore different facets of the store's operations, including tracks, albums, artists, and customer purchases. The project consists of 11 problem statements, each aimed at gaining insights into the store's business operations and customer behavior. By executing SQL queries and interpreting the results, I aim to derive actionable insights from real-world datasets.
